# fwends.co

The public website for FWENDS, built and operated by Fwends LLC. Plain HTML, CSS and
JavaScript, no build step, served by GitHub Pages from the root of `main`.

```

Links are root-absolute (`/privacy/`), so the site must be served from a domain root:
`fwends-co.github.io` or the custom domain `fwends.co`.

The header and footer are repeated in each page. When you change one, change all five.

## Preview locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000.

## Before Apple enrollment

- Replace `[ADDRESS TO BE PROVIDED]` and `[PHONE TO BE PROVIDED]` in `index.html`
  (search for `TODO`). The address must match the D-U-N-S record.
- `privacy/` is a draft (the terms page is parked in `_removed/terms.html`) and need legal review before the app launches.
  This is noted in an HTML comment at the top of each file.

## Custom domain: fwends.co

The domain's DNS is at GoDaddy. In GoDaddy DNS for `fwends.co`:

| Type  | Name | Value                  |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| A     | @    | 185.199.108.153        |
| A     | @    | 185.199.109.153        |
| A     | @    | 185.199.110.153        |
| A     | @    | 185.199.111.153        |
| CNAME | www  | fwends-co.github.io    |

Delete any other `A` records on `@`, and turn off domain forwarding or parking. Then, in
this repo's Settings → Pages, set the custom domain to `fwends.co` (which commits a
`CNAME` file) and tick **Enforce HTTPS** once the certificate is issued.
